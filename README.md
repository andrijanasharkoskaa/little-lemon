<p>Run the npm package with the command <I><strong>npm install</strong></i> to install the required dependencies in order to run the project</p>

<p>Then run <I><strong>npm star</strong>t</i> in the folder where the project is located to run it locally on your web browser.</p>

Install if needed:
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-ga4

(it might show some errors if these packages are not installed with the standard npm install, so you might need to install them individually)
